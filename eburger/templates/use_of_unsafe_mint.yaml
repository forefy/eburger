version: 1.0.0
name: "Usage of unsafe _mint"
severity: "Medium"
precision: "High"
description: "ERC721 _mint is used for token creation and updates the internal mappings of token ownership. Instead of using _mint directly, it's preferrable to use _safeMint, which is a safer extension of the _mint function, that's adding a security check meant to verify that if the recipient address is a contract - it's a contract that can handle ERC721 tokens correctly (by calling that contract's onERC721Received function)."
impact: "Tokens can be locked in contracts that can't support them."
action-items:
  - "Review calls to _mint in your contract, and if there's ever a chance of the recipient address of being a contact, replace it with a _safeMint implementation."
  - "If there isn't a possibility that the recipient will ever be a contract, you may keep using _mint to save gas costs."
